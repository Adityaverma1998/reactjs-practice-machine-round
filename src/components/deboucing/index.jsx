// What is debouncing?
// Debouncing a function ensures that it doesnâ€™t get called too frequently.

// Debouncing is a way of delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. 
// This can be useful for scenarios where we want to avoid unnecessary or repeated function calls that might be expensive or time-consuming.





// Why debounce? What problem does it solve?
// Say you want to move a box on the page every time you scroll the browser window.

    const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

            console.log('Debounced value:', search);

            clearTimeout(handler);
